# Data of an Unusual Size: A practical guide to analysis and interactive visualization of massive datasets

In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn the fundamentals of analyzing massive datasets with real-world examples on actual powerful machines on a public cloud -- starting from how the data is stored and read, to how it is processed and visualized. You will understand how large-scale analysis differs from local workflows, the unique challenges associated with scale, and some best practices to work productively with your data.

## Setup for SciPy 2024

You can use Nebari (JupterHub) hosted at [scipy.quansight.dev](https://http://scipy.quansight.dev/) to follow along with this tutorial.

Follow [this participant's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YWMZKW6Y4tXnMs3Jekc1S7BQWTR6THZazDaq3WoNxw/edit?usp=sharing) to register & sign-in, select the **Medium Instance** in the Server Options, and use the following link to clone the tutorial materials:
